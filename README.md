## Maven Hometask
- [x] Aggregate parent project. Create basic **pom**-project for declaring common properties, plains and dependencies. Also to keep everything in one place
- [ ] Plugin management. In parent project setup plugins section and add plugin Apache Maven CheckStyle plugin (https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/). Be sure that you build is failing in case check style rules are not met.
- [x] Dependency management. In parent project add jUnit and Spring Core dependencies.
- [x] Dependencies versions in properties. Still in parent project declare versions for jUnit and Spring. Use it whenever they need.
- [x] Human readable project names. Rename all modules names to avoid seeing ugly artefact ids after building project :)
- [x] Add project modules. Let project include following modules: dao, core, web
- [x] Web module should be **war**
- [x] Web module should be built with all dependencies in it.
